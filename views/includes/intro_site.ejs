                    Soon to be graduated from CÃ©gep Garneau in web development, I am someone in search of knowledge and skills to become a accomplished professional.
                    <br>
                    I am passionate about creating interactive and functional websites to offer the best possible experience.
                    <br>
                    My goal is to continue to evolve in this exciting field and contribute to the creation of innovative projects.

                        Please note that this portfolio site is not currently made with the recent technologies that I have learned.
                        It is presented for demonstration purposes and this site is not responsive (good visibility on mobile).
                        A better portfolio is coming soon. Lack of time is catching up with me with homework!
